                Engage Here CIC, is a community interest company that was set up in 2020 by Melissa Fry and Sam. Its purpose is to provide creativity for those who might normally find it hard to participate in the arts. At present Engage Here's main focus is working with people living with dementia or cognitive impairment as well their carers, many of which are unpaid family members.  The workshops are always free at the point of use and held in different community settings across London, predominantly in Camden, Hackney, Tower Hamlets and the City of London.

            <p class="about-paragraph">    
                Workshops lean towards craft-based processes rather than free-reign drawing or painting. This is driven by the idea of nurturing techniques that are repeatable, so that participants can continue to engage in them independently, to improve their wellbeing. This methodology increases the accessibility of Engage Here's programmes, by placing little focus on what the participants produce in the workshops and more focus on what they have learnt.

                Past examples of projects include dementia-friendly workshops at the British Library exploring their archive, printmaking workshops in response to Henry Moore's <i>Draped Seated Woman</i> for older people living in Tower Hamlets, weekly art workshops for users over the age of 55 at James Wigg GP practice in Camden, and accessible cinema screenings for Hackney residents at the Castle Cinema in Homerton.
