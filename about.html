        <p class="about-paragraph">
            Sam Ocean Eccles (SOE) is a graphic designer living and working in London. Upon graduating from Kingston School of Art, he has looked to work with clients who are operating within design, art, or the wider cultural sector. His main two focuses are print and websites, for which he is a trained front-end developer. With all his projects he aims to use a concise typographic approach to celebrate the collaborators work rather then distract from it. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">    
            Twice a year he is part of the team which designs the fashion magazine <i>The Gentlewoman</i>, having now worked on the latest 5 issues from 24â€“28. In addition to that he regularly works with Joe Hales studio, supporting him mainly on books for galleries.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph"></p>
            Separate to his practice as a graphic designer, Sam co-runs Engage Here, a community interest company delivering art workshops to people who experience barriers to participation. You can read more about this <a href="engage-here.html">here</a>.
